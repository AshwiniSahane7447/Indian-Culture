      <H1 align=center>Indian Monument</H1>
<img src="index/taj-mahal-agra.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right> 

With their elaborate superfluities and wonderful architecture, Indian monuments represent one of the most
 outstanding facets of the multi-faceted Indian culture. An architectural feat in itself, each Indian monument is a remarkably 
splendid sample of unbelievable artistry, covering a sense of mystery, deception and romance. Be it the marvel in white marble, 
the spellbinding Taj Mahal; or the red stone splendor, the magnificent Red Fort; or the magnificence of temple art of Khajuraho,
 Konark and Hampi , there is evident the master craftsmanship and elegance, that brings to the forefront the splendor of the bygone era.
 Monuments are witnesses of India's past; the monuments of India are also the guardian pillars of India's cultural heritage.

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Buland Darwaza</font><br>
<img src="index/buland-darwaza-fatehpur-sikri.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
Buland Darwaza or the loft gateway was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601 A.D. at Fatehpur Sikri. Akbar built the Buland Darwaza to 
commemorate his victory over Gujarat. The Buland Darwaza is approached by 42 steps. The Buland Darwaza is 52.62m high and 25 meters wide. Buland 
Darwaza is the highest gateway in the world and an astounding example of the Mughal architecture. The Buland Darwaza or the magnificence gateway is
 made of red and buff sandstone, decorated by carving and inlaying of white and black marble. An inscription on the central face of the Buland Darwaza 
throws light on Akbar's religious broad mindedness. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Char Minar</font><br>
<img src="index/char-minar-hyderabad.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right> 
The Charminar in Hyderabad was constructed in 1591 by Mohammed Quli Qutab Shah. He built the Charminar to mark the end of plague in the Hyderabad city. 
Since the construction of the Charminar, the Hyderabad city has almost become synonymous with the monument. The Charminar is a massive and impressive 
structure with four minarets. In the evening, with illumination, the great Charminar looks even greater. With the passage of time the Charminar occupied so
 much importance that it became the heart of all bustling activities. It is in the bustling bazaars around the Charminar that you find the traditional nahari
 stalls and kulchas of Hyderabad. Hyderabad is one of those few cities, which have a fine blend of modernity and tradition.

 <br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Gateway Of India</font><br>
<img src="index/gateway-of-india-mumbai.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
One of the grand and magnificent landmarks of Mumbai, the Gateway of India was built to commemorate the visit of the British Monarch, King George V 
and Queen Mary. The Gateway of India is one of the hot spots of Mumbai city. The Gateway of India is a massive archway on the Apollo Bunder. For most of the 
tourists and travelers, the Gateway of India is the starting point to explore the Mumbai city. The Gateway of India was designed by the architect George Wittet.
 The first stone of the Gateway of India was laid on March 21st 1912. The foundations were completed in 1920 and the Gateway of India was formally opened in 1924 by the
 then Viceroy, Earl of Reading. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Gol Gumabad</font><br>
<img src="index/gol-gumbad-banglore.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right> 
Gol Gumbad situated in Bijapur district of Karnataka is the second largest dome in the world. The Gol Gumbad is second in size only to St. Peter's 
Basilica, Rome. The Gol Gumbad is 124 feet in diameter. The architecture of Gol Gumbad is unique in the sense that the four minarets themselves are
 the staircases, leading to the top dome. Gol Gumbad is truly an amazing architectural wonder as the dome stands unsupported by pillars. The most fascinating 
and remarkable feature of the Gol Gumbad is its acoustical system. Even the faintest whisper around the dome echoes several times. The gallery around 
the dome of the Gol Gumbad provides a wonderful view of the town. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Hampi</font><br>
<img src="index/virupaksha-himpi-karnataka.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
Hampi was the capital of Vijayanagar Empire, the last great Hindu Kingdom. Under the Vijayanagar rulers Hampi grew fabulously. The princes of Vijayanagar 
built numerous Dravidian temples and palaces. The records of foreign travelers between 14th and 16th century bear testimony to
 the grandeur of Hampi. However the magnificent capital of Vijayanagar was destroyed by the Deccan Muslim league in 1565. Hampi
 is a village in northern Karnataka, India. It marks the ruins of Vijayanagar, the former capital of the Vijayanagar Empire. 
The Hampi village also houses the well-known Virupaksha temple. 
 
<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Humayun Tomb</font><br>
<img src="index/humayun-tomb-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right> 
After wandering in wilderness for 25 years, Humayun reoccupied Delhi in the year 1555 AD but he was not destined to rule any longer and died barely 
six months of his arrival, from a fall in his library, Sher Mandal. Humayun's tomb was built by his widow, Hajji Begum around 1565 AD. The Taj Mahal 
and many other Mughal buildings are said to have been inspired from Humayun's tomb. Humayun's tomb is one of the world heritage sites. The tomb of 
Humayun is based on Islamic paradise gardens. This type of garden is known as a Charbagh and is based on a grid system. The square garden is divided 
into four large squares and separated by causeways and channels with each square again divided into smaller squares. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>India Gate</font><br>
<img src="index/india-gate-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
India Gate, situated on the Raj Path in New Delhi, was built to memorialize the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the First World War,
 fighting for the British army. The India Gate also bears the name of 12,516 British and Indian soldiers killed during the third Afghanistan war, 1919. 
The foundation stone of India Gate was laid down by the Duke of Connaught in the year 1921 and was designed by the famous British architect, Edward Lutyens.
 It was Lord Irwin who dedicated India Gate to the nation in 1921. Later, another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti or the eternal soldier's flame was added to the monument. 
The Amar Jawan Jyoti is burning since 1971 to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971.

<img src="index/khajuraho-temples-khajuraho.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
Known for their breathtaking sculptors and elegance, the magnificent Khajuraho temples present aesthetics at its best. The beauty and elegance of the 
Khajuraho temples is beyond words and imagination. After visiting the Khajuraho temples one is left wondering about the advancement of Indian art and 
sculpture as back as the 10th century. Perhaps, there is no place other than Khajuraho, where all kinds of human emotions have been portrayed with such 
great excellence.

 <br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Mahabalipuram Rathas</font><br>
<img src="index/mahabalipuram-rathas-mahabalipuram.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>

 who built the magnificent 'Ratha' cave temples of Mahabalipuram in the 7th century. The Ratha temples at Mahabalipuram bear 
testimony to the artistic genius of Indian architects in ancient times. The Ratha temples also reflect the artistic tastes of 
the Pallava rulers. The Ratha temples gave birth to a new style of architecture, the South Indian temple architecture. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Nalanda</font><br>
<img src="index/nalanda-university-bihar.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left> 
Nalanda was a great center of Buddhist learning in ancient times. A large number of Buddhist students thronged the Nalanda 
University to study Buddhism. According to the Chinese traveler Hieun Tsang, the place owed its name to a Naga, who resided 
in a local tank. Lord Vardhamana Mahavir and Lord Buddha visited Nalanda quite frequently in the 6th century BC. Nalanda is also 
supposed to the birth place of one Sariputra, one of the chief followers of Lord Buddha. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3> Qutub Minar</font><br>
<img src="index/qutub-minar-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right> 
Qutub Minar is the highest stone tower in India. The construction of the Qutub Minar was started by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in 1199
 and it was finished by his successor and son-in-law, Iltutmish. The Qutub Minar was named after the Sufi saint, Khwaja Qutubuddin 
Bakhtiyar Kaki. Though the exact purpose of the Qutb Minar is not known but it is believed that it served as a minaret to the adjoining 
mosque and was used by the muezzins to call the faithful to prayer. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Sanchi Stupa</font><br>
<img src="index/sanchi-stupa-madhya-pradesh.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left>

 a railing with four carved gateways facing all the four directions. 
  
<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Taj Mahal</font><br>
<img src="index/taj-mahal-agra.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
Famous as one of the wonders, the Taj Mahal at Agra, India, is epitome of true love. Taj Mahal was built by the famous Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the memory
 of his beloved wife, Mumtaj Mahal. The architectural beauty and magnificence of the Taj Mahal has never been surpassed. The Taj Mahal is said to be the most
 beautiful monument built by the Mughal rulers and it represents the zenith of the Mughal architecture. Built entirely of white marbles, the beauty of the Taj
 Mahal is beyond description. The beauty of the Taj Mahal has been aptly summarized by the famous English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold, as "Not a piece of architecture,
 as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Victoria Memorial Hall</font><br>
<img src="index/victoria-memorial-hall-calcutta.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left>
The Victoria Memorial was built to commemorate the peak of the British Empire in India. The Victoria Memorial, conceived by Lord Curzon, represents the architectural

 The Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone of Victoria Memorial in 1906 and it was inaugurated in 1921 in memory of Queen Victoria. The Victoria Memorial is 228 by 
228 feet and a height of 184 feet. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Celllular Jell</font><br>
<img src="index/cellular-jail-andaman.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The one name that sends chills down the spine even today is that of Kala Pani Jail, located in Andaman. The jail still has the fear element in the air
 and anyone visiting the place can sense the pain the inmates went through back during the time this jail was functional. The British undertook the construction of 
the Cellular Jail and would send "dangerous" criminals from India to this place to undergo torturous treatments. The Andaman Island was used to house prisoners way back
 in the year 1857. The Cellular Jail of Andaman Island is now a protected monument and stands as a testimony to the torture meted out to the helpless prisoners. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Hawa Mahal</font><br>

 this beautiful monument is the landmark of Jaipur. The monument is five stories high and the front of the monument is delicately carved with beautiful motifs. It provides
 an outstanding example of Rajput style of architecture. Hawa Mahal is not exactly a palace but a screen of superbly sculpted windows that look like the front of a palace.

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Mysore Palace</font><br>
<img src="index/mysore-palace-karnataka.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
One of the largest palaces in India, Mysore Palace of Karnataka is a fine example of unique blend of different styles of architecture. The Mysore Palace is one of the
 most attractive and gorgeous monuments in Karnataka. It is also known by the name of Amba Vilas and was the residence of Wodeyar Maharaja. The Mysore Palace was rebuilt 
in 1912 after the original palace was destroyed in a fire accident in the year 1897. It was re-designed in Saracenic style by a famous British architect Henry Irwin. One 
can see the blend of different forms of architecture and design in the Maysore Palace. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Vivekananda Rock</font><br>
<img src="index/vivekananda-rock-tamilnadu.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=left>
Located in the midst of the ocean, just 400 meters from Kanyakumari, is the magnificent Vivekananda Rock Memorial. This colossal structure was built in the year 1970, 
under the guidance of Shri Eknath Ranade. The Vivekananda rock temple is dedicated to one of the greatest spiritual philosophers of India, Swami Vivekananda. It is said

temple was conceptualized on his birth centenary in the year 1962.
