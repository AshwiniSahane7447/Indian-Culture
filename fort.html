<img src="index/red-fort-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
Of all the Indian monuments, forts and palaces are most fascinating. Most of the Indian forts were built
 as a defense mechanism to keep the enemy away. The state of Rajasthan is home to numerous forts and palaces. 
Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are also not far behind. In fact, whole India is dotted with forts of varied sizes. 
The magnificent forts and palaces of Rajasthan were built during the medieval period. The notable feature about each of the forts 
and palaces is the exquisite carving work that has survived till date and still receives appreciation from people worldwide.
<br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Agra Fort</font><br><br>
<img src="index/agra-fort-agra.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>

The majestic Agra fort was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1565-75. The Agra fort contains numerous
 impressive structures like the Jahangir Mahal, Khas Mahal, Diwan-i-Khass, Diwan-i-Am, Machchhi Bhawan and Moti Masjid. 
The Agra fort is enclosed by a double battlemented massive wall of red sandstone. This wall is about 2 km in perimeter and is 
interrupted by graceful curves and lofty bastions. Many of the buildings inside the Taj Mahal were pulled down by Shah Jahan, who 
erected some new ones. The Agra fort has four gates, of which the Delhi Gate is the most impressive. 


<br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Amber Fort</font><br><br>
<img src="index/amber-fort-jaipur.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The Amber fort is set in a picturesque location a little away from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan state. The Amber Fort presents
 a fascinating blend of Hindu and Muslim architecture. Raja Man Singh built the Amber fort in the sixteenth century (the construction of the Amber
 Fort was started in 1592). The Amber Fort is built in red sandstone and white marble. The palace complex of the Amber fort has very attractive
 apartments. This complex was built by Raja Man Singh, Mirza Raja Jai Singh and Sawai Jai Singh, over a period of about two centuries. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Delhi Fort</font><br><br>
<img src="index/red-fort-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The Red fort (Lal Qila) at Delhi was built by Shah Jahan on the banks of river Yamuna. The Red fort at Delhi is one of 
the massive forts in India and is a witness to the heyday of the Mughal Empire. Shah Jahan built the Red fort as the citadel
 of Shahjahanabad, his new capital at Delhi. The Lal Quila or the Red fort rises above a wide dry moat in the northeast corner
 of the city of Shahjahanabad. Red fort's walls extend from two kilometers and differ in height from 18 meters on the river side 
to 33 meters on the city side.

<img src="index/gwalior-fort-gwalior.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The Gwalior fort spreads out over an area of 3 square km, surrounded by concrete walls of sandstone. The Gwalior fort encloses 
three temples, six palaces and numerous water tanks. At a point of time Gwalior fort was regarded as North and Central India's 
most invincible fortress. The fort was built by Raja Man Singh Tomar in the 15th century. The fort of Gwalior has seen many ups 
and downs of history. In the course of almost five hundred years, the Gwalior fort went from one ruler to another.

<img src="index/jaigarh-fort-jaigarh.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The magnificent Jaigarh fort is located near Jaipur. Jaigarh fort or the fort of victory was constructed by Sawai Jai Singh
 of Jaipur in 1726. The Fort stands in the middle of thorn and scrub hills, which impart it a stout look. The Jaigarh fort 
gives an amazing view of the city below. The purpose of building the Jaigarh fort was to strengthen the 
defense of Amber. It is the main reason why the Jaigarh fort is quite plain and simple. The fort is surrounded by a moat and all
 other arrangements seen in big citadels. Jaigarh Fort was also used as the treasury of the royal family of Jaipur. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Jaisalmer Fort</font><br>
<img src="index/jaisalmer-fort.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
One of the oldest and massive forts of Rajasthan, Jaisalmer fort is located in the remote Thar Desert. In the medieval times,
 the location of Jaisalmer on the trade route made it a prosperous town. Jaisalmer came to be celebrated for the chivalry and bravery of its rulers
 and also for the aesthetic sense represented by its palaces and Havelis. The rulers and merchants of Jaisalmer engaged craftsmen to work on the sandstone mansions,
 buildings and palaces, filling up the front with sculptural filigree, screen windows, delicate pavilions and beautiful balconies. The Jaisalmer fort is two hundred and
 fifty feet tall and reinforced by an imposing crenellated sandstone wall of 30 feet height. The fort has 99 bastions. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Junaqarh Fort</font><br>
<img src="index/junagarh-fort-junagarh.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
Located in Bikaner, the Junagarh fort is one of the most impressive fort complexes in India. Junagarh fort 
was built by Raja Rai Singh in 1588 AD. Junagarh fort is one of those few forts that are not built on a hilltop. 
The fort complex consists of palaces, courtyards, pavilions and balconies. The walls palaces etc. are ornamented with carved
 stones, marbles, paintings and inlaid semi-precious stones. Each palace in the Junagarh fort complex was built by a different ruler over the centuries. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Purana Quila</font><br>
<img src="index/purana-quila.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
The Purana Quila or the old fort was constructed by Humayun and Sher Shah. The old fort complex covers an area of about a mile. 
The walls of Purana Quila have three gates (the Humayun Darwaza, Talaqi Darwaza and Bara Darwaza) and are surrounded by a moat,
 which was fed by river Yamuna. The double-storied gates of the Purana Quila are quite massive and are built with red sandstone.
 The walls of the old fort are said to be built by Humayun while the buildings in the old fort are attributed to Sher Shar, the Sur ruler.
 Of all the surviving buildings in the old fort complex, the Sher Mandal and the Quila-i-kunha Mosque are notable. 

<br><br><br><br><font color="purple" size=3>Tuqhlaqabad Fort</font><br>
<img src="index/tughlaqabad-fort-delhi.jpg" width=165 height=120 align=right>
In a state of total ruin, the Tughlaqabad fort was once a symbolic of the might of the Tughlaq dynasty. The Tughlaqabad fort was
 built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, the founder of the Tughlaq dynasty. The fort is spread over an extensive area and a piece of architectural marvel.
 Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq built the Tughlaqabad fort as part of Tughlaqabad, the third city of Delhi. This was the period of political unrest and there 
was continuous danger of Mongol attack from the North western borders of the Empire. To save the Empire and his subjects from the marauding Mongols, 
Ghiyas-ud-din built the Tughlaqabad fort.
